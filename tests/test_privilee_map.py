    Feature being tested: This test checks the functionality of the filter and reset options on the map

   Expected outcome:When a filter is applied, the displayed venues should match the filter category
   (e.g., "fitness venues" or "pool & beach venues").After applying the filter, the venue count should
   decrease when a specific location (e.g., Dubai) is selected. When the filter is reset, the venue count
   should return to its original value.

  Importance: Filtering is a key feature for improving the user experience, as it allows users to quickly
  narrow down their options based on preferences. Ensuring the filters work correctly and reset properly
  is crucial for user satisfaction and data integrity.
